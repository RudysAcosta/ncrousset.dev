      <h1>Hi, I'm Rudys Acosta <img class="emojin" src="/assets/img/bald-guy-sunglasses-beard.png"> </h1>
      <p>
        Full Stack Developer with over 10 years of experience building diverse web 
        solutions for companies, streamlining processes, and delivering innovative products using a wide range of technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Passionate about web development, anime, movies, series, and video games, I love developing projects for my personal use. I am currently studying Computer Science at Essex County College.

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I create ideas in code and automate processes to improve my clients' performance. In recent years, I have
        dedicated myself to freelance development and personal projects, creating ERP, CRM, CMS, and eCommerce systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Java &amp; Enterprise</h2>
      <p>
        I specialize in backend development with Java. I have a solid understanding of enterprise applications. I work with Jakarta EE APIs such as Servlets, JAX-RS, JPA, CDI, JSP, and JTA. I also have experience deploying and configuring applications on Apache Tomcat for production environments.
        Within the Spring ecosystem, on Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring MVC, and Spring Security to build scalable, secure applications. I am also experienced with tools like Maven, Docker, Git, and JUnit/Mockito for testing.
    </p>

      <h2>Other Stacks</h2>
      <p>
        I also develop in PHP using Laravel. On the frontend, I enjoy working with React and Tailwind CSS, and I have
        professional experience with Vue.js and Angular.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other technologies I work with daily include Docker, Git, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Nginx, and AWS. If I had to define myself in one word, it would be “passionate.” I am always open to learning and working with new technologies, including those I have used in the past, such as Ruby on Rails and Angular.
